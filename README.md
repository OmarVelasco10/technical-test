This project is a frontend and backend simulation for using a library.
The backend was simulated with json-server which simulates the functionality of a real backend, because we can make requests to the backend and get results.
And the interface was built with react, loading.io, HTML and CSS.
This project has validation for all input and email. It also has a component for backend response management.
To run this project you only need:
+ Open a terminal and you should run "npm start" to start the frontend.
+ Open a second terminal and run "npm run fake-api" to start the backend.
